WHATEVER
========

that code is a quick and dirty hack to get notifications over ssh from my server
running irssi to my workstation. Aimed to be extended with other notification
systems.

for original notify.pl code :

 * http://lewk.org/log/code/irssi-notify

INSTALL
=======

 * REMOTE SHELL running ERC

TODO by someone who uses ERC!

 * REMOTE SHELL running IRSSI

1/  copy 'notify.pl' to your ~/.irssi/scripts folder
    i.e. scp notify.pl REMOTE:.irssi/scripts
2/  do '/load perl' and '/script load notify.pl' in irssi
    - TIP: Add it to your irssi conf to auto load
3/  Ensure SSH allows remote tunnels - i.e. GatewayPorts yes
4/  configure the 'highlights' in your client. (if you don't know how RTFM !)
    - /hilight -regex bla|bla

 * Local SSH Client

1/  install the local service either by doing: 
    1.1/ pip install notossh
    1.2/ python setup.py install
4/  configure how you want to instance it
    4.1/ configure your ssh client to run it (see below)
    4.2/ make your own script (or launch it manually) : `notossh start`
    4.3/ to end the service run : `notossh stop`
6/  if you don't like it as is... HACK IT !

OPTIONS
=======

    usage: irssi-notify-listener.py [-h] [-f] [-S] [-V] [-H HOST] [-P PORT]
                                    [-G GROWL] [-N NOTIFY]
                                    {start,stop} ...

    IRSSI Notify Listener

    positional arguments:
    {start,stop}
        start               Starts the service
        stop                Stops the service

    optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -f, --foreground      Make the notifications stick
    -S, --sticky          Make the notifications stick
    -V, --verbose         Make the listener verbose
    -H HOST, --host HOST  Host to listen on
    -P PORT, --port PORT  Port to listen on
    -G GROWL, --with-growl GROWL
                            Path to growl executable
    -N NOTIFY, --with-notify NOTIFY
                            Path to notify executable

CONFIGURATION
=============

add to your .ssh/config those lines, where HOST is the host and port the PORT you want
to connect to :

    Host HOST
    PermitLocalCommand yes
    LocalCommand "/path/to/bin/notossh start"
    RemoteForward PORT localhost:PORT

NOTIFICATIONS
=============

to change the way notifications behaves, like on Fedora systems, you can change the notification
line to the following, making it transient :

    return [args.notify, '--hint', 'int:transient:1', '-i', 'dialog-information', '-t', '5000', ':'.join(args[1:]), args[0]]

TODO
====

 * enable passing through the arguments after -- to the notification service

LICENCES
========

Since 2010, that code is aimed to be hacked.
Thanks to Charles `doublerebel` Philips, Rui Abreu Ferreira and Cooper Ry Lees for their hacks!

notify.pl is under GPL (because I copy/pasted it from Luke Macken and Paul W. Frields)

everything else is WTFPL (because I don't care what you do with it, but if you don't 
tell me you've improved it it, you're just a moron)

And if you like it, buy me a beer !
